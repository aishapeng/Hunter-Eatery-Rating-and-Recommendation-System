# Hunter-Eatery Rating and Recommendation System
## Intro

As modern consumers, people rely on restaurant recommendation applications to solve our daily struggle, which is making decisions on "what to eat today"'s questions. With just a few clicks, a list of recommended restaurants which matches our preferences is shown on the screen.
In this project, the team wants to build an eatery rating system that acts as a platform for users to share and rate their experiences for the eateries and suggests the most suitable eateries for users. Also, the team has provided a random recommendation selection for the users based on their current location. The ranking lists are real time updated - the team does not want users to get bored with the same information! 
Hunter is a mobile application built using Java programming language in Android Studio. Mobile phone with Android OS is required to run the Hunter mobile application.
